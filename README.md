# Tidyverse developer day

## Workflow

[Overview slides](overview.pdf)

### 1. Find an issue to work on

* [Issues tagged tidy-dev-day](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22tidy-dev-day+%3Anerd_face%3A%22)
* [Issues tagged help-wanted](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted+%3Aheart%3A%22+&state=open&type=Issues)
* [Issues tagged reprex](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Areprex+&state=open&type=Issues)

You're encouraged to team up with a (new) friend and tackle something together!

### 2. Claim your issue

Add a comment to the issue thread, saying that you're working on it so no one duplicates work.

At useR! Toulouse, we plan to pilot a post-it note based system for **physically** claiming an issue. Stay tuned.

If you work on an issue that doesn't already have the tidy-dev-day label, please comment requesting that @batpigandme add it. This makes it more visible to us and helps us track tidyverse developer day activities.

### 3. Make a PR

If you have never done a PR before, feel free to ask for help from any of the designated helpers. Our whole job today is to help people through these mechanics.

[Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com) describes some relevant workflows, such as:

  * [Fork and clone](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html) then [Add the `upstream` remote](https://happygitwithr.com/upstream-changes.html#add-the-upstream-remote)
  * [Push](https://happygitwithr.com/push-rejected.html) and [pull](https://happygitwithr.com/pull-tricky.html) when there are commits on GitHub that you don't have
  
  
The usethis article [Pull request helpers](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/pr-functions.html) shows how to work through a PR using the `pr_*()` functions.

  * **Fork** and clone (see above) and **create a new non-`master` branch**.
    - `usethis::create_from_github()` + `pr_init()` are great for this! Make sure your Github personal access token is configured before you use `create_from_github()`, otherwise you will just clone the repo instead of forking and cloning it. See the docs for `create_from_github()` (or the above resources) for instructions! 
  * `devtools::install_dev_deps()` to make sure you've got the necessary packages.
  * `devtools::check()` to get baseline, hopefully all is well.
  * Make your change. Add a test or two, if relevant.
    - Iterate quickly with `load_all()` and `test()`.
  * `devtools::document()`
  * `devtools::check()` to make sure all is still well.
  * Add a bullet to NEWS describing the fix or feature.
    - Be concise, link to issue, tag yourself.
    - Example: "`use_circleci()` creates a `.circleci/config.yaml` config file
      for CircleCI (#703, @jdblischak)."
  * Push and make a PR.
    - `usethis::pr_push()` is great for this!
    - Make the title descriptive:
      - Not good: "Working on issue 45"
      - Much better: "Use stricter regexes for package and file name checks"
    - Use the [magic keywords](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords),
      like "Closes #123", in the description, to hyperlink & close your issue.
    - Example with descriptive title and description containing magic keywords:
      [r-lib/usethis/#742](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/pull/742)

**Who?** Anyone who would like to get better at contributing to the tidyverse! Everyone is welcome regardless of whether you've never done a PR before, or if you've already made your 10th package. But please get a ticket (see below).

**What?** A day of learning and coding. We'll provide food; you'll bring your laptop and enthusiasm. The tidyverse team and other community helpers will be on hand to help out and answer your questions.

### Squad goals

The broad goal of this event is to nurture regular contributors to the tidyverse by having a day where we can work together on anything ranging from submitting your first pull request, to working on a package. The tidyverse team will be there, so we can help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that you encounter. Don't have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We'll be tagging issues in advance to make sure there's lots to do for any- and everyone, regardless of level of expertise.

### Tickets

Tickets are [~~on sale now!~~](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidyverse-developer-day-tickets-51757053741) __sold out__.
